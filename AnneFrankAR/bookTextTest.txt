           A Farewell to Arms follows one Frederic Henry, an American Lieutenant working with the Italian Ambulance service during WWI. The book includes many autobiographical details of Hemingwayâ€™s own life, focusing heavily on real accounts of the war. The violence is not glorified, and the tragedies that befall the characters were all too real for the Lost Generation - those who came of age during the war. Hemingway was targeted among other authors as 'corrupting foreign influences.' His works on and about the war were considered by the Nazi party to disrespect the memories of those who fought and died in WWI.
